# ML-SumOfDigitsCNN - Learning to Add Digits
Mini Project 3 for Comp 551, Fall 16 at McGill University
## Datasets
Datasets and preprocessed data sets can be found [at this location](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fDRaInnrmotkufEK1YxWtH-lu--tm4Yp)
## Models
### Logistic Regression
L1 logistic regression used to obtain sparse solutions as the data is high dimensional. Implemented using sklearn library.
[logisticAndAugmented.py](logisticAndAugmented.py)

### Neural Networks
Implementation of neural networks from scratch can be found in file [neuralNet.py](neuralNet.py). Neural nets are trained on to identify the digits separately and then the predictions are summed.
### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
[cnn.py](cnn.py)
